            <h2>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <p>
                <strong>An interface for programming online documents is the Document Object Model (DOM).</strong> It depicts the structure of an HTML or XML document as an object tree, with each object standing in for a different component of the document, such as an element, an attribute, or a text node. It is possible to modify the structure and content of a web page programmatically using the DOM.

            <h2> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <p>
                <strong>Here are a few of the more popular ones:</strong>

              Using the specific id attribute, the getElementById function chooses an element.
              
              An illustration is document.getElementById ("myElement")
              
              Using the class attribute, the getElementsByClassName function chooses elements.
              
              For instance, use document.getElementsByClassName ("myClass")
              
              With the getElementsByTagName function, elements are chosen according to their tag names.
              
              For instance, use document.getElementsByTagName ("p")
              
              The first element that a specified CSS selector matches is chosen using the querySelector method.
              
              For instance, "#myElement" in document.querySelector
              
              All elements that match a specified CSS selector are selected by the method querySelectorAll.
              
              An illustration is document.querySelectorAll (".myClass")
        
              These techniques are used to choose elements from the DOM tree, and they can be combined with other DOM techniques to change, add, or remove elements from the page.

            <h2> What is event bubble?</h2>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <p>
                <strong> An event that is triggered on one element in the Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> will also trigger on all of that element's ancestor elements up to the document's root due to a phenomena known as event bubbling. This means that when an event takes place on a child element, like a button's click event, it will "bubble up" to the parent element, then the grandparent element, and so on, until it reaches the top of the document tree.

                In order to create interactive online applications, it's crucial to use the event bubbling method, which enables event handling at various DOM levels. A click event can be added to each item in a list, for instance, if you have a list of items.

            <h2>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <p>
                <strong>A callback function is a function </strong>that is supplied as an argument to another function with the idea that it will be invoked at a later time during that function's execution. It is a "called back" function, to put it another way.

                When a function must hold off on performing its own logic until an asynchronous operation is finished, callbacks are frequently employed in asynchronous programming. Asynchronous operation results, such as a server response or a user action, are handled by the callback function.
                
                Consider using a callback function for the following reasons:
                
                Anytime you must wait for an asynchronous activity to finish, such as a network request or a user action, you are programming in an asynchronous manner.
